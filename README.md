# Barad-Dur
This project is a tutorial project to use a Raspberry Pi to stream some content recorded from a network stream, for example via rtsp protocol.

The web part will be built based on the python framework Flask, which you can install through pip with (sudo) pip install flask. 

First version of the soft implements a simple webapp that can run on Raspberry Pi to record a RTSP video stream for a while, and then display it on loop on the Raspberry Pi's video output.
