This project is a tutorial project to use a Raspberry Pi to stream some content recorded from a network stream, for example via rtsp protocol.

The web part will be built based on the python framework Bottle, which you can install through pip with sudo pip install bottle. 

More info can be found in the Bottle documentation: http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html
